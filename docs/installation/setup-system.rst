Setup your system
###################

In this section, we will go through setting up a Raspberry Pi 4 to be used with AMPL. If you're able to setup a Raspberry Pi Bookworm OS
(or similar Linux OS) on your system and configure SSH & internet connectivity, you can skip to :doc:`install`.

Raspberry Pi
====================

1. Install the latest version of Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm (lite) using the `Raspberry Pi Imager Tool <https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/>`_
   onto your Raspberry Pi's microSD card.

   In the flashing options, set the hostname to `AMPL`, enable SSH, and enable WiFi if you'd like.

   **You will need internet on your Raspberry Pi when you boot it up, so either configure WiFi or plugin an ethernet cable**

2. Boot up the Raspberry Pi and connect over SSH.
